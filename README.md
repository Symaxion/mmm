=============================

What is it?
-----------
Multi Minecraft Manager allows you to have and manage multiple instances of 
Minecraft, each with a different configuration and set of mods.

Aren't there already a lot of tools out there that do this?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Yes, but as far as I know they are either Windows only, use custom launchers or
require other complex set up. MMM works right out of the box and uses the 
normal Minecraft launcher.

Features
--------
* Manage an unlimited amount of different Minecraft instances.
* Works on all operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux).
* Launch the default Minecraft instance from MMM as well.
* No extra setup required (No Java in PATH, no Mono, no runtimes) <sup>[1]</sup>
* Stores instances in a known, convenient location (%APPDATA/.mmm on Windows, 
  ~/Library/Application Data/MMM on Mac, ~/.mmm on Linux)
* Uses the official launcher, or any launcher you want, including SpoutCraft!
